This example performs the classical Gauss-Elimination with back
substitution to solve a linear equation. It does not perform
pivotization, but serves as a simple example for shared memory use.

Compiling

This code should be compiled using the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit. Simply
edit the Makefile and change the variable ROOTDIR at the beginning to
point to the C/src subdirectory of the SDK (where all the example
codes reside), and then run make. In case you do not want OpenMP
parallelization for the CPU code, you can specify NOOMP=y with make.

Unlike the NVIDIA examples, this Makefile puts the resulting
executable into the local directory, in the bin subfolder.
